IMPORTANT - This file represent the NOODAI parameters and default values for the omics profiles related to the ccRCC work from doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.01.31.635927
Mandatory Steps:
1. Insert the sample names as High,Low,Rhabdoid,Control with no quotes.
2. Insert the contrasts of interest as HighvsControl with no quotes. THE CONTRASTS MUST BE THE NAMES OF THE EXCEL SHEETS!
3. Upload the compressed file that contains each omics measurement profile in a separate Excel file. All tables must have the same contrasts if you want to combine them. The column 'UniProt_ChEBI' must be present for the contrasts and omics profiles for which you have measurements. Use UniProt IDs.
4. Press the submit button

In short:
Samples names = Low,High,Rhabdoid,Control.
Sampels contrasts = HighvsControl,ControlvsHigh,LowvsControl,ControlvsLow,RhabdoidvsControl,ControlvsRhabdoid.
