IMPORTANT - The demo and default values are for omics profiles related to humans! To run the pipeline for other organisms, consult the tutorials.
Mandatory Steps:
1. Insert the sample names as M1,M2a,M2c with no quotes.
2. Insert the contrasts of interest as M1vsM2a,M2avsM1,M1vsM2c,M2cvsM1,M2avsM2c,M2cvsM2a with no quotes. THE CONTRASTS MUST BE THE NAMES OF THE EXCEL SHEETS!
3. Upload the compressed file that contains each omics measurement profile in a separate Excel file. All tables must have the same contrasts if you want to combine them. The column 'UniProt_ChEBI' must be present for the contrasts and omics profiles for which you have measurements. Use UniProt IDs.
4. Press the submit button

In short:
Samples names = M1,M2a,M2c.
Sampels contrasts = M1vsM2a,M2avsM1,M1vsM2c,M2cvsM1,M2avsM2c,M2cvsM2a.
DTU file name = DTU (for advanced usage only).
